// best practise when using prisma and nextjs to 
//be sure that only one prismaclient is being created
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client"

declare global {
  var prisma: PrismaClient | undefined
}

const client = globalThis.prisma || new PrismaClient()
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") globalThis.prisma = client

export default client
